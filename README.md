## Installation
### From PyPi
```
pip install cmos-noise-map
```

### From Github
To install the tool, clone this repository and run:

```
pip install poetry
cd cmos-noise-map
poetry install
```
## Tests
To run the unit tests, simply run:

`poetry run pytest`

## Usage
Once you've installed the tool, it can be run simply by:
`rts-maker <path> <options> <write filename>`

```
Usage: rts-maker [OPTIONS] PATH FILENAME [METHOD]

  This script builds a noise map with the chosen method.

  path: Path to input without the .fits at the end

  filename: Path to write file, including the filename ending in .fits

  method: Default method is std. Available methods are std, rts, and param.
  See docs for more information about each method.

Options:
  -r, --data_ext INTEGER          Extension of fits file that contains the
                                  image data
  -uq, --upper_quantile FLOAT     Standard deviation cutoff for pixel noise
                                  evaluation
  -t, --tolerance FLOAT           The minimum difference between silhouette
                                  scores. See docs for more information.
  -m, --min_peak_separation FLOAT
                                  Minimum difference between pixel value
                                  cluster centers to be considered separate
                                  clusters
  -o, --out_hdu_name TEXT         Name for the header in which the data will
                                  be stored
  -f, --fpack BOOLEAN             Adding this option will fpack your output
                                  fits file
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
